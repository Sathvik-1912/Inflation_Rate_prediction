Introduction

Inflation refers to the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services rises, leading to a decrease in the purchasing power of money. In simple terms, it signifies an increase in price levels of everyday goods and services. Inflation is usually expressed as a percentage. One of the key indicators to measure inflation or deflation in an economy is the Consumer Price Index (CPI). In India, the CPI replaced the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) in 2013 as the primary measure of inflation.
